### WHAT IS IT?

***METAPLACE*** is a marketplace for the ***METAVERSE***, you

can read all about the product and decide which products to purchase.
You can also view your entire purchase history. You can **add funds** to 
your wallet to purchase a product. Anybody with access to the internet 
can use this marketplace. 

I am interested in what the metaverse might become in the
future and since it may be a virtual world for everyone,
I wanted to know how the metaverse may grow and I do 
think this would be one of such additions to the metaverse 
in the mere future.
